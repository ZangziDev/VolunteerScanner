# Volunteer Scanner

## Background

We need a way to verify a person has checked in with one of leads to ensure we know they showed up but also that we can provide them (and us) a way to ensure they know where to go. We want to make sure maps and location info is readily available. We also will then save that data to, currently, Google Sheets for easy tracking.

## Setup

To start "go mod tidy" to make sure that the right packages are pulled.

## Build

Initial Build Guide is basically 'go build'
